## Description

In this project I was working on using some basic javascript to add user interactivity to a given website. I added JS to prompt the user to enter data about their employees. Once the user no longer wanted to enter more employees, i created an object for each employee and added each one to an array. from there I added code to calculate the average salary of the given employees and selected a random employee from the list, and logged all of that info to the console. There was also a small bit of data validation, using the isNaN function. 

## Usage

to use this website properly, all that must be done is the user should click the add employees button and then follow the prompts. make note of the fact that if there is not a number input for the salary option it will default to $0 which may affect results if that was not the users intention. 

## Credits

curly-potato on github- contributed starter code which included all HTML, CSS and some the structure of the javascript file.
